<p>
  I'm an undergrad at Harvard University (class of '27) interested in research, education, and deep learning.
</p>

<p>
  I was born and raised in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, where I lived with two loving parents and an evil little sister.
  I graduated from Union High School (go Redhawks!) in 2023, and I'm currently a first-year at Harvard.
  I love to learn and teach, and my goal is to be a professor, since they seem to do a lot of both.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently working as a teaching fellow at Harvard and a student AI researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.
  I have a few years of prior research experience at the University of Tulsa, where I was employed as both a research apprentice and part-time researcher during my last two years of high school.
  I have many years of informal primary and secondary education experience, teaching basic programming and tutoring math up to and including differential equations.
